                    My journey with HTML and CSS started unexpectedly with curiosity and a desire to blend creativity with
                    technology.I stumbled upon tutorials on YouTube and was instantly
                    drawn in. What began as a curious click soon became a deep dive into the world of web development.
                    I was so hooked that I quickly grasped the ins and outs of HTML and CSS, and my hunger for knowledge
                    urged
                    me to explore JavaScript. While navigating the realm of JavaScript, I stumbled upon an advanced course
                    by
                    one of my favorite programmers (Samvel [Sami] Hayrapetyan) - the same person whose tutorials had
                    kickstarted
                    my coding journey.
                    Without a second thought, I joined his course. His teaching had been invaluable in my knowledge
                    learning, and this new opportunity was too good to pass up.After mastering the basics of JavaScript, I
                    dived
                    into its cooler features and intricate concepts. The advanced course I completed was packed with
                    valuable
                    theory and practical exercises, which deepened my understanding.From theory to practice, I embraced
                    every
                    challenge, eagerly absorbing the complexities. It was a journey
                    that expanded my skills and fueled my passion for using JavaScript creatively.
                    After finishing the course, I discovered Vue.js.Its elegance and functionality immediately captivated
                    me, prompting me to immerse myself in tutorials, documentation, and various resources about Vue.
                    The more I delved into Vue.js, the more I appreciated its simplicity and power in building dynamic and
                    responsive user interfaces.
                    After delving sufficiently into Vue, my curiosity led me to explore Nuxt.js.The transition from Vue to
                    Nuxt felt like discovering a shortcut to efficient and scalable web development. It empowered me to
                    build robust applications while maintaining the flexibility and simplicity that initially drew me to
                    Vue.
